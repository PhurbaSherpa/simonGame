This was my very first application that I made and is the reason why I continue to code. Even though this was a tutorial into learning about the DOM and how to manipulate it, it also challenged me to think more about coding. This application made me incorporate logic and think of how a game flow works. I didn't just need to know how to manipulate the DOM but how to actually use that manipulation to create a game. 
Being a person who loves games and problem solving, I'm glad this was the first application that I created, it just made me fall in love with coding. 

# Description
A game where you must remeber the pattern of colors, every round a single color is shown which is added to the previous list of colors. The whole pattern isn't shown only the next color, so you MUST keep in mind of all the color.
